# Scratch REST API
Welcome to the Scratch REST API! Here you can find information on how to read and write data from and to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) programmatically.

### This API is in development
Right now, we're in the process of building the next version of Scratch. Part of that includes building this REST API to allow people to access the site's data directly. It might take some time to complete the entire thing, but we will continue to update this repo with new documentation as we build new parts of the API.

### To Get Started
Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-rest-api/wiki) to find out more information about how to use this API, and what features are currently available.

Also make sure to check out Scratch's [open source web client](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www) too!
